Designed as a companion for https://github.com/iconic/illustrator-svg-exporter

This script will rename all objects in the style "x0000.000y0000.0000" based on the artboard pixel center coordinates. This is very useful if you want to reconstruct the artboard in another program as you can parse coordinated from the filename. It also suffixes ".svg" in line with requirements for the afforementiones export script.

Could probably be incorporated as a fork, but for now it just works as a script to run before exporting
